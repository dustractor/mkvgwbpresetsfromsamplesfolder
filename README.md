*"Make Voxglitch Wavbank Presets from Samples Folder"*

scan your samples folder and make voxglitch wavbank presets for every directory containing a minimum number of wavs



VCV Rack2 modules store presets in text files with the ``.vcvm`` extension and they are just json so that means it is fairly straightforward to use python to edit/analyze/create them.
